  Progress Quest (ver7, c++/Qt version)
  Martin Horner (xeno@morgoth.net) - Sep 2012

  This software owes a great debt to Eric Fredricksen and his original
  Progress Quest written in Delphi pascal also the subsequient javascript
  version.

  Progress Quest started (if I understand correctly) as a joke. A sort of
  internet meme that went out of control. If I interpret the joke correctly
  (and I certianly might not), Eric was pointing out that most MMORPG's
  (RPG's?) are just time consumption. There were certinly other aspects to
  the joke, but I think that was the main point.
