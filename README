  Progress Quest (ver7, c++/Qt version)
  Martin Horner (xeno@morgoth.net) - Sep 2012

  This software owes a great debt to Eric Fredricksen and his original
  Progress Quest written in Delphi pascal also the subsequent javascript
  version.

  Progress Quest started (if I understand correctly) as a joke. A sort of
  internet meme that went out of control. If I interpret the joke correctly
  (and I certainly might not), Eric was pointing out that most MMORPG's
  (RPG's?) are just time consumption. There were certainly other aspects to
  the joke, but I think that was the main point.

COMPILE HINTS:

    We leave the compile business to QT Creator. It makes us happy.

    We aren't above suggestions for changing how to change this to use
    CMake or some other nice builder. Please email xeno, but be warned,
    he may have something else to do and guarantees nothing.


NOTES:

    Yes, I am considering a package set once pq7 is released (at time of writing
    we are in beta10). I consider a lot of things. Most of which are dismissed at
    some point after they have sufficiently annoyed me.

    No, once pq7 is completed, I'm moving immediately to pq8 which is a much more
    extensive vision of pq than a remake of 6. I will not be refining pq7 after
    release. That will be left (mostly) to the community.

    That being said, improvement suggestions and bug reports are always welcome.

    Actually, they will be snickered at immediately and subsequently forced to
    preform demeaning tricks. At some point a respect for the email may develop
    and actions taken on it's behalf, but don't hold your breath. We are a cruel
    bunch around here.
