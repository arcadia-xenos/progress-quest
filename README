  Progress Quest (ver7, c++/Qt version)
  Martin Horner (xeno@morgoth.net) - Sep 2012

  This software owes a great debt to Eric Fredricksen and his original
  Progress Quest written in Delphi pascal also the subsequient javascript
  version.

  Progress Quest started (if I understand correctly) as a joke. A sort of
  internet meme that went out of control. If I interpret the joke correctly
  (and I certianly might not), Eric was pointing out that most MMORPG's
  (RPG's?) are just time consumption. There were certinly other aspects to
  the joke, but I think that was the main point.


DOWNLOADING:

Found at github:

https://github.com/arcadia-xenos/progress-quest.git


COMPILE HINTS:

Requires Qt4 libraries (4.8.1ish), jsoncpp libraries,  C++ with standard libs
    QT Creator (QT's IDE and form creation environment) is a plus.

jsoncpp can be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsoncpp/files/
    or svn'd from http://jsoncpp.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsoncpp/trunk/

The github fetch will provide a complete project for Qt Creator.

If you've never used Qt Creator, consider this an opportunity to make a new
best friend.


Notes:

    Yes, I am considering a package set once pq7 is released (at time of writing
    we are in beta10)

    No, once pq7 is completed, I'm moving immediately to pq8 which is a much more
    extensive vision of pq than a remake of 6. I will not be refineing pq7 after
    release. That will be left to community.
